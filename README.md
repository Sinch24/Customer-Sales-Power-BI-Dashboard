## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

As part of the course, I completed a **capstone Power BI project** simulating a real-world analytics scenario for a retail company. This involved building an interactive, end-to-end BI solution using multiple datasets.

### ðŸ§¾ Project Scenario
Analyze sales performance and customer behavior for a fictional retail company to support business decision-making.

### ðŸ§± Key Steps

#### 1. Data Import & Transformation (Power Query)
- Loaded datasets: Sales, Customers, Products, Regions, Calendar
- Cleaned data: removed nulls, standardized columns
- Merged tables using joins
- Created new calculated columns (e.g., Total Revenue)

#### 2. Data Modeling
- Created a star schema model
- Built relationships between fact and dimension tables
- Added hierarchies (Year > Quarter > Month)

#### 3. DAX Calculations
- `Total Sales`, `Total Quantity`, `Profit Margin %`, `YoY Growth`
- Used functions like `CALCULATE`, `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`, `DATESYTD`, `FILTER`

#### 4. Report Design
- Pages: Overview, Sales Trends, Regional Insights, Customer Analysis, Product Analysis
- Visuals: KPIs, Line Charts, Maps, Pie Charts, Matrix Tables
- Added slicers, tooltips, drill-throughs, bookmarks, and buttons
